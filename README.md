# Weather Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for the current and future weather conditions of a specific city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and display it in a user-friendly manner.

## Features

- Search for a city: Users can enter the name of a city in the search box to retrieve the weather information.
- Current weather conditions: The dashboard provides the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index for the searched city.
- 5-day forecast: Users can view the 5-day forecast, including the date, temperature, and humidity for each day.
- Search history: The application keeps track of the user's search history, allowing them to easily revisit previously searched cities.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure and layout of the web page.
- CSS: Styling the elements and customizing the appearance.
- JavaScript: Handling the API requests, data manipulation, and dynamic content.
- Bootstrap: Utilized for responsive design and pre-styled components.
